# Safe-Kids-Project

We aim for our project to benefit everyone, regardless of age. Itâ€™s designed not only to help youth but also to support parents and guardians in teaching these important lessons. Many parents struggle to explain these topics to their children, and some kids don't feel comfortable discussing them with their parents. This website will guide children through these subjects independently and provide a refresher on things that parents might not teach anymore, expecting kids to catch on their own.
